# html-start-pack
My gulp pack

This build has multiple branches depending on what you need
1) low-pack : the most minimal build.
It is intended more for further customization than for explicit use
What does this build do:
html files are divided into modules (connection of individual blocks ), reduced in size after the final assembly
Autorun of the server with automatic page refresh when files change.
2) low-pack-and-css - everything is the same as in low-pack and in addition css: Combining several files and importing into one
Creating a smaller version
Combining identical media expressions
3) medium-pack - everything is the same as in the last two, only css has been replaced with sass
